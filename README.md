# Pangloss Frontend

FrontEnd part of the Pangloss project made with Angular 7.
For more information about Pangloss, please take a look at the [backend documentation](https://gitlab.com/crafts-records/pangloss/pangloss-backend-java-springboot1).

## Launching the front

Run `ng serve` to launch the front without HTTPS and navigate to `http://localhost:11759/`. In that case you'll have to start also the backend without HTTPS.

To enable HTTPS, run with `ng s -c ssl` and navigate to `https://localhost:11759/`.
